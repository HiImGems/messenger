# messenger
During the process of the app you will be able to give and receive messages
And this will be a basic structure for 2 separate layouts in the messenger app
This means that the code is segmented into two parts
Receive and sending are the necessary parts of the application
the code is made up of making the layouts work whilst the java file is separated into the two separate parts of the application themselves
The first part of the app looks like this https://github.com/HiImGems/messenger/blob/master/screenshot/layout-2016-02-29-114706.png
The second part of the app that receives the messages looks like this https://github.com/HiImGems/messenger/blob/master/screenshot/layout-2016-02-29-114734.png
